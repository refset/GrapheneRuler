This a super old project that feels like yesterday. All my thoughts were scattered and messy (as per the code). They still are! Also I still haven't used Git much, forgive me.

I was amazed to be able to launch graphenenew.html and see it working perfectly (as perfectly as it ever did anyway) just now. It runs fast and watching those circles transition definitely still gives me butterflies. Have a play :)
